## 🚀 Professional Summary

After graduating in Computer Science in 2018, I’ve been on a journey of continuous learning and growth both technically and personally. I’m passionate about creating impactful software and contributing to projects that go beyond code, especially those that help people who didn’t have the same opportunities I had.
